### Database Schema

- I used Product database to show all types of relations and features of Spring Hibernate.
- In this project we have the Product table which has 1 to Many and Many to Many relation with other tables.
- 1 Product can have many Attributes and Attributes are attached with the categories.
- Many Product can have multiple categories.
- 1 Category can have multiple attibutes.

### Spinning up the backend

Before building and running the backend we have to ensure that the application properties files has setup correctly and accordingly.

Following are the must have properties.

```bash
spring.application.name=Backend
spring.datasource.driver-class-name=com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver
spring.datasource.url = ${DATASOURCE_URL}
spring.datasource.username = ${DATASOURCE_USER}
spring.datasource.password = ${DATASOURCE_PASSWORD}

spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto = update
spring.jpa.hibernate.naming.physical-strategy=org.hibernate.boot.model.naming.PhysicalNamingStrategyStandardImpl

server.error.include-message = always
```

Please add these app properties in your application and donot forget to replace the configurations {your-configs}.

After adding the application properties. Use the following commands to spin up the spring security project.

```bash
  cd backend
  mvn spring-boot:run
```

- Backend is now ready to accept the requests.
